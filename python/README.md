# Python

This directory contains my learning materials related to Python,
with a focus on cybersecurity and red team fundamentals.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal is to learn Python as a tool for:
- understanding how security tools work internally
- automating simple tasks
- working with networks, data, and the operating system

This is a learning-oriented directory, not a production codebase.

## 📁 Structure
- `basics/` — core Python concepts and syntax
- `networking/` — sockets and network-related experiments
- `parsing/` — working with logs, text, and data
- `automation/` — simple automation scripts

## 📌 Notes
Code may be simple, experimental, or incomplete.
The focus is on understanding concepts rather than writing perfect code.
